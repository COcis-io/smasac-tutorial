        abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Dual-CNN, a semantically-enhanced deep learning model to target the problem of event detection in crisis situations from social media data. A layer of semantics is added to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to capture the contextual information that is generally scarce in short, ill-formed social media messages. Our results show that our methods are able to successfully identify the existence of events, and event types (hurricane, floods, etc.) accurately ({\ensuremath{>}} 79\% F-measure), but the performance of the model significantly drops (61\% F-measure) when identifying fine-grained event-related information (affected individuals, damaged infrastructures, etc.). These results are competitive with more traditional Machine Learning models, such as SVM.}

        abstract = {When crises hit, many flog to social media to share or consume information related to the event. Social media posts during crises tend to provide valuable reports on affected people, donation offers, help requests, advice provision, etc. Automatically identifying the category of information (e.g., reports on affected individuals, donations and volunteers) contained in these posts is vital for their efficient handling and consumption by effected communities and concerned organisations. In this paper, we introduce Sem-CNN; a wide and deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for identifying the category of information contained in crisis-related social media content. Unlike previous models, which mainly rely on the lexical representations of words in the text, the proposed model integrates an additional layer of semantics that represents the named entities in the text, into a wide and deep CNN network. Results show that the Sem-CNN model consistently outperforms the baselines which consist of
statistical and non-semantic deep learning models.}
